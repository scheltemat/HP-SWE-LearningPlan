## Overall Objectives for learning:

By the end of the first two weeks. I will have developed my skill in:

[//]: # (The example\(s\) below should be specifics of the content that you plan on covering over the course of the 2 week learning period. Additionally, they should be based directly on feedback from your manager.)

- _Example:_ Python programming fundamentals
- _Example:_ SQL queries fundamentals
- _Example:_ DDEX as domain knowledge

## Goals/Deliverables to show Success

I will have completed the following courses/resources/tasks/artifacts as evidence for development:

[//]: # (The example\(s\) below are EXHAUSTIVE, and should be attinable within the scope of the two weeks. You can have stretch goals if you like, but be reasonable with yourself in terms of what is a fair workload)

- _Example:_ Python
  - Python for Programmers - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python-for-programmers)
  - Build a Basic Game - [Pong](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-python-tutorial-pong/)
  - Planning for advanced [projects with LLMS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/development-with-large-language-models/)
- _Example:_ Domain Knowledge - DDEX
  - Summary Notes - [Watch and review DDEX Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEMlOLR48Xw)
  - Summary Notes - [Watch and review Intro to DDEX Standards Implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gckVvLEr1Q4)
  - Cheatsheet - [summary of DDEX standards](https://ddex.net/standards/)

## Learning Schedule:

[//]: # "Complete this outline to show what you plan on covering each day - remember however, that this will likely change depending on your pprogress.  That is fine - just update it when you need to!"

- Monday [3/31]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhAxLiGC7Pc and maybe a small app
- Tuesday [4/1]: build a todo app
- Wednesday [4/2]: continue building todo app, start weather app, watch David's .NET video
- Thursday [4/3]:
- Friday [4/4]:
- Monday [4/7]:
- Tuesday [4/8]:
- Wednesday [4/9]:
- Thursday [4/10]:

## Daily Record:

[//]: # "You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly."
[//]: # "***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***"

| What content plan to cover         | ASP.NET Core Full Course for Beginners, possibly a small app                                                                                                |
| What content I actually covered    | About half of the ASP.NET Full Course video, but plan to finish it today and begin working on a basic app                                                                                         |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I'm seeing a lot of similarities to other frameworks, so it seems promising to be able to learn it effectively.        |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I struggled a lot at the beginning just getting C# and .NET installed and able to run on my machine. Tried it on my Macbook as well and also ran into the same issues, so I had to figure that out before continuing. Otherwise, I feel good about my ability to learn now that the config is done.        |
| Reflections for the following day  | I feel like I'm on track, I'm also starting with more advanced implementations, rather than just a simple "hello world" app, so I think I'm plenty capable of learning this on my own. |

| What content plan to cover         | Build a todo app and watch David's video on .NET                                                        |
| What content I actually covered    | Almost done building the todo app                                                            |
| Reflection on what I learned today | Today I learned how to connect a MS SQL server datatbase to a .NET project and began learning how to create an MVC app in .NET       |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I struggled with the db connection for a while, but through a combination of Stack overflow articles and a lot of trial and error, I got it to connect       |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm on track still, but tomorrow I want to spend time learning more about building the app rather than the setup and congiguration |

| 4/2/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | I want to streamline the todo app and start another app and practice working with 3rd party APIs, as well as watch David's video on .NET.                                                                                                  |
| What content I actually covered    | I spent more time than I wanted trying to figure out how to simplify the todo app, and started the weather app which I plan to complete tomorrow. I am also going to finsish the day today watching David's video                                                                    |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I'm getting a better understanding of the MVC approach that .NET uses. I've used Rails, which is an MVC framework, but I didn't use the views with it, I used a react app.            |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | A lot of my learning today was just poking around in the app and trying things until they worked, as well as looking at stack overflow articles.       |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm still on track to learning what I need for this week and next week.  |
