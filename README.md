## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)     

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| Today's Date  |         | 
|---|---|
| What content plan to cover  |  # This should match your learning schedule above |   
| What content I actually covered | # This is the content you actually managed to get through  |  
| Reflection on what I learned today |  # How this will apply on the job, something you found enjoyable, insightful, difficult, or questions that arose as result of the learning |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | # Why was today a good or bad day?  What patterns am I noticing in myself when learning?  How effective was I today as an independent learner?  |
| Reflections for the following day| # Am I on track against my original goals, or is there a need to adapt? What support will I need from my coach with any changes I may need to make? |
