## Daily Record:

[//]: # "You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly."
[//]: # "***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***"

| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | ASP.NET Core Full Course for Beginners, possibly a small app |
| What content I actually covered    | About half of the ASP.NET Full Course video, but plan to finish it today and begin working on a basic app |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I'm seeing a lot of similarities to other frameworks, so it seems promising to be able to learn it effectively. |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I struggled a lot at the beginning just getting C# and .NET installed and able to run on my machine. Tried it on my Macbook as well and also ran into the same issues, so I had to figure that out before continuing. Otherwise, I feel good about my ability to learn now that the config is done. |
| Reflections for the following day  | I feel like I'm on track, I'm also starting with more advanced implementations, rather than just a simple "hello world" app, so I think I'm plenty capable of learning this on my own. |

| 4/1/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | Build a todo app and watch David's video on .NET |
| What content I actually covered    | Almost done building the todo app |
| Reflection on what I learned today | Today I learned how to connect a MS SQL server datatbase to a .NET project and began learning how to create an MVC app in .NET |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I struggled with the db connection for a while, but through a combination of Stack overflow articles and a lot of trial and error, I got it to connect |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm on track still, but tomorrow I want to spend time learning more about building the app rather than the setup and congiguration |

| 4/2/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | I want to streamline the todo app and start another app and practice working with 3rd party APIs, as well as watch David's video on .NET. |
| What content I actually covered    | I spent more time than I wanted trying to figure out how to simplify the todo app, and started the weather app which I plan to complete tomorrow. I am also going to finsish the day today watching David's video |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I'm getting a better understanding of the MVC approach that .NET uses. I've used Rails, which is an MVC framework, but I didn't use the views with it, I used a react app. |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | A lot of my learning today was just poking around in the app and trying things until they worked, as well as looking at stack overflow articles. |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm still on track to learning what I need for this week and next week. |

| 4/3/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | Complete a small weather app to practice consuming 3rd party APIs, maybe practice connecting .NET to a database or start a full stack application |
| What content I actually covered    | Couldn't do the weather app due to API key validation taking ~24 hours, so instead I created my full stack hackathon project to test if I could connect a Blazor front end to a .NET web API. Also gave me a chance to practice database connections again |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I did some more research on .NET to figure out what type of app I want to make for the hackathon. Learned about Blazor apps and how to connect them to an API |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I felt very productive today and felt like I got a lot done, as well as practicing putting all the pieces together with a full stack app in the .NET ecosystem |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm very much on track, I want to also go back to some basics with C# now that I have the application figured out |

| 4/4/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | Watch David's video, practice writing programs in C#, work on weather app, setup plant app even more |
| What content I actually covered    | Watched David's video, which helped me add User model and controller to plant app to practice creating models and CRUD operations in .NET, wrote a string reversing program in C#. Might abandon the weather app because it's still saying my API key is invalid over 24 hours later |
| Reflection on what I learned today | Setting up and configuring a project is no longer the hard part for me, it's doing basic things like setting up CRUD operations on models. Not sure how much I learned, but I think I can at least model future features off of what I have currently |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | Like I said before, things I can do in other frameworks are harder for me to figure out in .NET, also it's hard for me to understand error messages, but I'm slowly getting there. Even though I have snags, I usually get around them with dilligent research |
| Reflections for the following day  | I still need to practice the basics, but I'm still feeling good about my progress |

| 4/7/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | Work on writing C# programs, try building authentication into plant app |
| What content I actually covered    | Wrote a 2 sum solution in C#, worked on auth ALL DAY, but getting pretty close |
| Reflection on what I learned today | Auth is not something I'm super knowledgeable on, so I hope that building something and implementing it myself will help me better understand it |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I realized pretty late that building custom auth is a bad idea for me, so I scrapped all of that work in favor of an auth package. Rebuilt my User model and methods. |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm doing well, I'm resourceful and able to get things done that need to get done and my project is almost all setup so that during the build week I don't need to focus on hard things like user auth |

| 4/8/25 |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | My only goal is to get the authentication built out on the plant app |
| What content I actually covered    | I struggled all day to get this to work with cookies until I decided to scrap it for token auth and didn't actually get it working until the next morning |
| Reflection on what I learned today | I'm more familiar with tokens, so I think I should just stick with token auth to eliminate headaches. But I would like to learn cookie auth at some point |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | Cookies = hard, token = easier, but still hard. But I just keep chugging on |
| Reflections for the following day  | I think I'm definitely on track, doing all of this prework to setup my application shell will allow me to build out a feature-rich app during the hackathon. |

| Today's Date |  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What content plan to cover         | # This should match your learning schedule above |
| What content I actually covered    | # This is the content you actually managed to get through |
| Reflection on what I learned today | # How this will apply on the job, something you found enjoyable, insightful, difficult, or questions that arose as result of the learning |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | # Why was today a good or bad day? What patterns am I noticing in myself when learning? How effective was I today as an independent learner? |
| Reflections for the following day  | # Am I on track against my original goals, or is there a need to adapt? What support will I need from my coach with any changes I may need to make? |
